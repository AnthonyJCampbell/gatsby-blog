description: How to deploy a simple serverless node.js api using Zeit's now service.
---


Ever since I stumbled across next.js, Iâ€™ve been somewhat of a Zeit fan-boy.

For those who donâ€™t know [next.js](https://nextjs.org) is a frame work built on top of React. It makes doing things that are normally relatively hard, of at least fiddly, super simple. For example: a pages folder handles routing - each file maps to a url; and server-side rendering is included out of the box.

Zeitâ€™s entire philosophy centres on making complicated processes very simple. This was definitely the case with next, and is also true for their flagship product: [Now cloud hosting](https://zeit.co/).

Now allows you to deploy, to an automatically generated (and unique) url, using a single command:

```bash
$ now
```

With now 1.0 that was literally it. Zeit's software would then Dockerise your project and deploy it to the cloud.

## Now goes serverless

However, with [now 2.0](https://zeit.co/) Zeit made the move to go fully serverless; creating an architecture build on top of AWS's lambda. It's now required to have a simple configuration file, which is slightly more work - but ultimately a far superior product.

The configuration is fairly straight forward:

```javascript
// now.json
{
    //highlight-next-line
    "version": 2
}
```

First, specify the version. (2 refers to the newest serverless version of now, this is required to build serverless projects).

```javascript
// now.json
{
    "version": 2,
    //highlight-start
    "builds" :[
        { "src": "package.json", "use": "@now/next" }
    ]
    //highlight-end
}
```

Second, specify the build: Zeit provides a number a builders for different projects. 

The build above is for building a server rendered next.js app (which is it bit confusing as it's serverless - but basically it is rendered in the cloud instead of the browser. Maybe server-side rendering needs a new name...?).

There are lots of different builders available, from python to golang.

Another awesome option is @now/static-build. This allows you to build react apps (and presumably many other things - although I haven't tried) into statically served sites. 

This is great for performance, particularly when serving projects built with create-react-app (have you ever tried loading a non-cached create-react-app hosted on heroku? ðŸ˜¦).

##Building an API

Above are a couple of simple examples. However, building apis is where things get really interesting.

Traditionally, if you were to build a node.js api, you would: 
* Install express
* Set up a server
* Define a series of functions to handle different endpoints and request methods

```javascript
const app = require('express')();

app.get('/hi', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send('hi!');
});

app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send('hello!');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

When deployed this app would run on a single server and be running all the time.

With serverless a very different approach is taken. Each endpoint is simply a single function. When a request hits that endpoint the code for that specific function is fired up, it serves its purpose and then stops running.

This has a number of consequences:
* First, there is no set up what so ever - the developer simply writes their logic for each endpoint and does not have to worry about the infrastructure AT ALL.
* Second, the app can scale infinitely with no configuration, on the developers part (each request maps to a function on a 1:1 basis, so each time a new request comes in a new instance of the function is fired up)
* Third, cost is drastically reduced - code is only running when it needs to.

So, this all sounds great, but how does it work in practice?

###Building a node.js API with now

Building a serverless api with node and now is, unsurprisingly, rather straightforward.

To achieve the same result as the above express based api, we simply need to do the following:

Create a few folders:

```bash
api/
|--- hi/
|-------index.js
|--- hello/
|-------index.js
```

Export a simple function in each index.js file to handle a request:

```javascript
// api/hi/index.js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
    res.end('hi');
}
```

```javascript
// api/hello/index.js
module.exports = (req, res) => {
    res.end('hello');
}
```

Finally, we just need to create a now.json file to define our builds:

```javascript
{
    "version": 2,
    "builds": [
        // highlight-next-line
        { "src": "api/**/*.js", "use": "@now/node" }
    ]
}
```

Hit:

```bash
$ now
```

In the terminal, and we are good to go.

And that's it. Zeit will automatically create an unique url (you can also alias to a url of your choice), and create routes based on the file structure.

You can try out the two end points [here](https://ns.matts.now.sh/api/hi) and [here](https://ns.matts.now.sh/api/hello).

Magic!

So deploying a serverless api with now is super simple. But what about testing locally? There is no server, so how do we run it?

This is the topic of my next post: now-boom.
